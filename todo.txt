Would like to write these up more thoroughly and/or archive them, since recipes sometimes/often disappear from the Internet or my brain. But this works for now since it is closer to the right place.

roughly, with queso fresca as well, can sub Lime Tajin or cayenne if you want

Mango slices with cayenne pepper

This was quite good! Made with red peppers, could see also adding an additional jalapeno or something to give it a kick

Salmon + wine + lemon + capers in foil recipe

Monica's salmon recipe

Grilled salmon with cayenne, cumin, Tajin, salt, pepper, chipotle powder, with lime on top and squeeezd over it

Cheater BBQ pork recipes
 - Molasses Vinegar Pork Butt
 - Ultimate Cheater Pulled Pork
 
Grilled veggies
 - best type of container, IMO
 - things that are good in it (cherry tomatoes, onion quarters, peppers of any sort, zucchini, squash, pineapple even, maybe garlic)
 - possibly using Italian dressing
 - salt, pepper

Carrot + cauliflower turmeric dish (also good on the grill!)

Progressions / variants of grilled cheese:
 - basic grilled cheese
 - Monte Cristo sandwiches (see Fresh20 recipe, since that was awesome!)
 - Anthony's jalapeño popper grilled cheese sandwiches
  - cream cheese on base
  - jalapeño peppers, sliced small
  - cheddar
  - optional meat like bacon
  - optional egg added to melted butter for top
 - three-sisters-sandwich (need to improve since link is broken)
 - French Toast (essentially grilled cheese with just the bread and egg and some different spices)
 - pan croutons (after I have actually tried this)
 

Delete turmeric chicken recipe or others that I have not tried

Chicken salad http://allrecipes.com/recipe/222912/chicken-salad-with-apples-grapes-and-walnuts/

Stuffed chicken caprese meal
 - https://cafedelites.com/caprese-stuffed-balsamic-chicken/
 - I did this on the grill and it was pretty good, although the cheese melting / keeping the chickens together were slight problems
 - great summer meal / tastes. Would actually pair well with the lamb stuffed peppers or some grilled corn / veggies.

 - Made twice. Both times were really good, first was actually better (saltier?)
 - Made in large cast-iron skillet and I thought this was a good approach.
 - Second time:
   - 6 lb of meat turned into around 5 lb after trimming, was not enough for like 17 people. Would have doubled?
   - I think I threw a little Mexican oregano in there this time
   - Possible to overcook, try to stick to under 4 hours. It might not look done but when you check the temperature it will be.

Hell's Kitchen Egg salad sandwiches:
 - http://sherrissanity.blogspot.com/2012/02/hells-kitchen-knock-off.html
 - used croissants as the bread and this was good
 - think I threw a little hot sauce in there as well and/or chili powder and paprika since I didn't have any cajun seasoning.
 
Pasta with parsnips and bacon
 - was pretty good
 - http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2Frecipes%2F1015979-pasta-with-parsnips-and-bacon&oq=cache%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2Frecipes%2F1015979-pasta-with-parsnips-and-bacon&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.2070j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&strip=1
 - I should have cooked the parsnips longer since they were slighly underdone and getting them a bit more golden/crunchy would go well with the rest of the recipe.
 
Parsnip gratin
 - https://food52.com/recipes/19693-parsnip-gratin-with-melty-gruyere-and-thyme
 - thought it was good and hearty, a bit time-consuming. Having a mandoline was helpful
 - leeks were good
 
Oatmeal
 - cook fruit in separate pan
 - cook oatmeal with water to start, add cream or milk toward end
 - oats that take a while are best
 - can throw granola in if you want to add a lot of decent stuff (raisins, nuts, etc.) easily. Does add sugar though
 - fruit can be apples with pumpkin spice or cinnamon, berries (simmer for a while in orange juice), etc.
 
Buffalo chicken mac and cheese
 - general inspiration: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/buffalo-chicken-mac-and-cheese/d5a9fd21-a136- 4b43-baaf-b7ed79b6b38b
 - using cream cheese, cheddar cheese, gorgonzola seems good
 - having celery salt while cooking and fresh minced celery at end was a good combo
 - put the buffalo sauce (see buffalo chicken sandwiches for sample recipe) on the chicken and let it soak
 - rotisserie chicken is good for this
 - make the sauce "cool" with cheese, ranch powder, celery salt, etc.
 - the chicken is "hot" with spices and red onions
 
Monica's lasagna

F20 favorites (dry-brined chicken, kofte, etc.)

Chili
 - red pepper, poblano pepper, fresh garlic, white onion, 2 packs ground beef from costco, kidney bean can, black bean can, tomato juice, fire roasted tomatoes, jalapenos, cinnamon, paprika, chili powders (chipotle, regular, ancho, cayenne, etc.), maybe a little red wine if you have it
 - cook ground beef with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powders, maybe some liquid smoke
 - combine rest of ingredients above in crockpot or on stove on low for like 4 hours. Taste seasonings after a few hours and adjust
 - add dark chocolate toward end (1/2 hour cook time remaining?)
 - limes, sour cream, cheddar cheese, cilantro, raw jalapenos and garlic as garnishes
 

Lemon rice soup (lemon, rice, chicken broth, carrots, celery, onion, dill, more?)


https://minimalistbaker.com/sweet-potato-chickpea-buddha-bowl/
 - used asparagus instead of broccolini
 - used hummus instead of tahini
 - overall thought it was good, could have been more filling (more chickpeas?)
 - I liked the chickpeas especially and overall the recipe was easy since it was just throwing a bunch of stuff in the oven at the right times
